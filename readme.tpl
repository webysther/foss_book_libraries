# 📖 Free and OpenSource Book Libraries

There are many great free and open-source alternatives to closed source and/or paid book libraries. 
This project aims to track and compare the feature set between the many different options with a focus on 'Gratis' (free as in free beer) open source photo libraries. 
'Libre' (free as in free speech) projects are also welcome, but will likely need to be submitted via a pull request since the time in testing each different project is significant.

> [!WARNING]
> This repository displays both objective and subjective measures of feature quality.
